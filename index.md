<p style="font-size: 0.75em;">
I’m Software Engineer, and I’ve been a developer for more than eight years.
I’ve built apps about education, mental wellness, legal assistance, and video streaming, and I worked as Tech lead, teacher, CTO, mentor, speaker, leader, facilitator, Full Stack, and Backend developer.
I’m also an organizer at Ruby Peru and Tech Talks communities and a WTM Lima ambassador.

<p style="font-size: 0.75em;">
In my spare time, I use to play with my child and talk about technology.
I’m obsessed with programming and promoting women's participation in technology.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 0.75em;">
I can learn fast, and that helps me to switch technology easily.
I've worked with Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Django (Python), React (JavaScript and TypeScript), React Native, Electron, and Vue.
